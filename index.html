            <p>"Violet! Today let's go to the mall!" Ella said, jumping on my bed.
                "Alright!" I yawned as I got off from bed. We went to eat breakfast and we left the house. "Ella, we forgot to ask mom!"
                "About what?"
                "That we're going somewhere,"
                "but, your 18."
                "I know," I said. "But I have to,"  I said as I got my phone and started to call mom.
                "Hey, do you see that?" Ella asked. I nodded. "Ummm..."
                "what?"
                "Can we go inside there?"
                "No way!" I said as I called mom. "Yeah okay, okay, what? Why, okay, but Ella is whinging to go, okay. Ok. Bye." I said in the call.
                "What happened?" Ella asked.
                "Nothing, we just have to go back home."
                "Why? Call dad! He will agree, won't he?"
                "No, and they will get into a fight!" I said. Ella nodeded. "Okay, now let's go," I said scarsticly weird, but then Ella just ran anyways. "Ella!" I yelled.
                "No! I won't listen to you! Someone wil have to go inside!" Ella scremed as she went inside. I tried to her in like 'Ella I will give you 20$' 'Ella I won't tell mom anything', but nothing worked!
                "Ella please! Don't leave!"
                "Bye!" Ella yelled.
                "Bye," I said looking at her dispappered in that pastel poral. I walked back to the house-
                I just ran to Ridha's house where she she lived with Kaitlyn, Liza, Aubrey, Joise, Irene, Lorenzo, Lillian, Charlotte, Brynn, and Vivian. When I went inside:
                "Oh hello Violet! You look... uh tired."  Vivian said as she opened the door for me.
                "Yeah, actullay Ella-"
                "What? Ella!" Vivian got shocked for a moment.
